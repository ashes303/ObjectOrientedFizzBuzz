FizzBuzz OOP solution

This is an experiment in implementing the now clich√©d FizzBuzz problem using various OOP patterns. I've devided the code between two packages representing an application layer and business logic. I've used the [Strategy Pattern](https://www.pmi.org/disciplined-agile/the-design-patterns-repository/the-strategy-pattern) to make the logic extensible without modification.
